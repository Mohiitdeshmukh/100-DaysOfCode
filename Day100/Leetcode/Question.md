# Question - Regular Expression Matching

## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/description/

## Description

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

## Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20

1 <= p.length <= 20

s contains only lowercase English letters.

p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.

It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character '*', there will be a previous valid character to match.
